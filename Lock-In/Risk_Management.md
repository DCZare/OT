#### General

- Abolish fishbowl?
  - Return to mediation committee-run discourse
  - Maybe we cab use more mediation committee without getting rid of Fish Bowl all together
  - Fish Bowl was not a semester long thing
  - Pre-chapter fishbowl as opposed to a semester-long one
    - Abolishing may be too extreme
    - We should probably do a lock in fishbowl
    - Every meeting may be too extreme,
      -  perhaps monthly
   - If its a month/semester long then only mediation head can read it all month/semester
   - Mediator can get the main point across without everyone needing to see the less constructive phrasing
   - Fishbowl has been a very negative outlet this semester
     - Its all negative frankly
     - Was more of a ranting ground than constructive criticism
   - Some feel the fishbowl hasnt really helped beyond venting
     - Few tangible changes have been made as a result
     - Perhaps 1-2 people per pledge class on the committee for a wide range of experiences and input
    - Expanding mediation could lead to a concentrated version of the same situation we have now
      - That being said, we could benefit from more representatives to go to without too many leaders (too many cooks in the kitchen)
      - Mediators should be a closed 95% vote
        - Felix feels he couldve been chosen arbitrarily
          - Even though its because nobody could have an issue with him, i mean look at him
        - If nobody reaches 95, it goes to the highest voted party
          - With room to veto from eboard????
          - Heierarchal voting?
          - One way of voting could be allowing multiple votes for anyone you have confidence in
        - A committee of 5 could effectively give us the scope of views and approachability we're looking for
          - Class would vote for chi beta class representative
          - Or class should nominate the rep and then OT votes
          - One round of anonymous vetos
            - If it still passes the threshold after a talk then oh well
              - Move that revote to the next meeting so points can be brought up with anonimity
- Review a Bylaw every week?
  - Positive concensus
- Do more with reviewing the codes/symbols
  - Once at the beginning of the semester, first chapter
  - once at the chapter before midsemester
  - before initiation
- Alcohol Presentation should be cleaned up and standardized
- For PBA and similar events, hosts should be more informed and guests should be more coordinated by the host for their expectations
