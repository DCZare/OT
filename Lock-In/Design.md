Design head should put together apparel ideas before the semester budget is even made so they're prepard to ask for a specific number
- As opposed to guessing a number and working with it

Come up with tentative design ideas with arbitrary and estimated amounts of buyers

Design/Fundraising Collabs

- When reaching out to alumni, there needs to be a collaborative effort with the Treasurer and both committee heads to work out the cost distribution for brothers/alumnis

Rush shirts are split cost between BOC and Design Budgets

Ary had a very good idea

- Regarding getting some time of letters to the shinies immediately
  - Since we are moving from hoodies to line jackets we can pre-order generic Letters and distribute to the incoming kiddies
  - We could buy a stockpile with the expectation of moving units to incoming classes
  - You could ask pledges if they want to pay for it
    - Then they could have letters *AS SOON* as they cross

We should have a specified inventory list for specifically apparal

- (as opposed to the items like tables/dartboards/cornhole/etc)

Ideally designs are made in advance enough so a budget can be propsed with them in mind WELL before the threshold

- Make a design history document as they are made to have old shirts/to pitch new ones
- Make sure design lead still picks 2 to vote between
