- If you want an event to exist, you better plan it and find a committee who's budget works best
- Dont just expect the accompanying committee head to do everything
  - Answer interest forms if you actually care
- A lot of events had near-zero attendence
  - We need to work on engagment
  - Can't rely on alcohol to garner interest
- Would it be crazy to take attendence at every fraternity event?
  - To judge events, not people
- We should focus on attendence for existing events before we try to increase events
- Plan social events before the semester so people can interject with professional/resume building/community serving replacements

What events do we want that people will actually show up to?

- Intramurals
  - Basketball Team
  - Vollyball Team
  - Soccer Team
  - Oozefest
- Wine Nights
  - Not necessarily wednesday
- Passing Phone Numbers with other social orgs
  - Phi Rho
- Drive in Movie
- Canalside Ice Skating
- Camping Trip
  - ~~Camping~~ **Glamping** Trip
    - Vermont???
    - Maybe make it part of Regionals?
- What if we did a ~~Wine~~ **Pot** Night
- Blue Jays Game?
- Bills/Sabres/Bisons
  
Formal

- Could be talked about before the semester begins
- Same with a trip

We should do a better job of defining BOC from Brotherhood

- When the event comes up/if the idea is just had, we can define what committee it represents and what committee budget works best
  - Not always the same, but its important to reach out to the involved committee heads even if those heads don't need to be directly responsible for coordination

For the next brotherhood head

- We need to stress the importance of interest polls **FAR** in advance of the "2 week before rush" threshold
- Work **CLOSELY** with the next treasurer
- Make sure brothers know *what we're paying for*
  - And also what we're not paying for

What Edward thinks about this

- Why dont we just let the committees spend a *teeny* bit over budget (something reasonable)
- Then we can reflect on the planned budget and the resulting expenses and refine our future budgets from there
- We need to keep track of all lateral budget use
