# **Theta Tau Construction Meeting**

# Agenda

Today's agenda is as follows:

- Test Arduino with the pnumatics
- Finalize a functional prototype of the wafflemaker's open/shut mechanism
- Explore mounting options for mix injection


---


### Pnumatics

In order to get pnumatics working for the wafflemaker to pivot and serve a finish waffled
- We need to power solenoids that are triggered with the arduino
- And we need air tanks to release the pressure into pistons when the solenoids are triggered
- Then a compressor to fill the tanks for use


### Wafflemaker

For the waffflemaker's open and closing system
- We need to make mounts for the servo and wafflemaker
- Also we need to string the wafflemaker handle to the servo in a way that doesnt interfere with pivoting
- And we dont need the servo to be at the peak height, we can route a longer string that way
- we need to gear the output shaft of the servo to give us much more length change per degree than 1:1


### Mix Injection

With the mix injector:
- This system needs to not be in the way of the opening and closing
- So it likely has to be above the whole thing and drip down from above
