# Solenoid Notes

---

### Piston

- Powered seperately
- Triggered with a solenoid
- Forces air in two inlets to open and close
- Air comes from tank
- Tank fills from compressor

### Solenoid

There isn't really an Arduino language as such. It's really just C++ with some domain-specific libraries.

The first step is calling the pins we'll be working with for our solenoid

```c++

int signal_pin = 21; //Pin 21 on the ESP32 (labeled on back)
```
Here is the setup code for the paramters of the loop. The pinmode is set to output because it is sending information (signal triggering voltage to pass). Input would 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:

pinMode(signal_pin, OUTPUT); // Set the signal pin as an output

}

```

Here is the looping section of the script such as seeking *(waiting)* for triggers

```c++


void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

digitalWrite(signal_pin, HIGH);
delay(5000); //waiting
digitalWite(signal_pin LOW);
delay(5000;) //waiting

}
```
